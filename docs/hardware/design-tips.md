# Design Tips

**Want your hardware build to come together cleanly the first time?** This page is a short checklist of habits that experienced makers reach for, grouped by where you are in the build: the whole project, the PCB, the 3D model, and the README. None of it is required, but every tip here saves you a reprint, a reorder, or a round of review feedback.

Work through the section that matches what you are doing right now. You do not need to read it top to bottom.

## General design

These four habits keep your project **buildable**, which is the thing reviewers and future-you both care about most.

- **Design for manufacturing.** Think about how your project will actually be built. If you can't assemble it, redesign it.
- **Include tolerances.** 3D printers aren't perfect. Add 0.2-0.5mm of clearance for parts that need to fit together.
- **Model everything.** Include all electronics in your CAD model, not just the case. This prevents "oh no, the battery doesn't fit" moments.
- **Keep it simple.** If your design has 50 parts and you've never built anything before, scope it down. You can always iterate.

## PCB design

A few rules of thumb keep your board **quiet** (less electrical noise) and keep your first order from coming back broken.

- **Keep traces short.** Shorter traces mean less noise and better signal integrity.
- **Use a ground plane.** Pour copper on the bottom layer for ground. It reduces noise and makes routing easier.
- **Decoupling capacitors go close to the IC.** Not across the board. Right next to the power pins.
- **Route power traces wider.** They carry more current. 0.5mm minimum for signal traces, 0.8mm+ for power.
- **Run DRC before ordering.** The Design Rule Check catches errors that would ruin your board.

## _3D modeling_

Small modeling choices decide whether your print is **strong, comfortable, and easy to mount**.

- **Fillet your edges.** Rounded corners look more professional and are more comfortable to hold:

  *After*

- **Think about print orientation.** The direction you print affects strength and surface finish.
- **Add mounting holes.** Even if you don't have a case yet, mounting holes make it easy to attach your board later.
- **Test fit before final print.** Print a small section first to check that tolerances are right.

## README tips

Your README is the first thing a reviewer reads. A **clear** one makes your project easy to understand and easy to approve.

- Start with a one-line description of what the project does
- Include a photo or render of the finished product
- List all components with links to where you bought them
- Include assembly instructions, even if brief
- Add a "What I'd do differently" section. Reviewers love seeing self-awareness.
